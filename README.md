# SF-Airbnb-Host-Analysis

The project is a continuation of my coursework in MGT4187 Managerial Analysis at CUHK(SZ). 
As it was a collective project then, I am grateful to my teammates who contributed valuable analytical insights.

Unfortunately, the original dataset from Inside Airbnb for Shanghai is no longer accessible. 
Therefore, I have taken the initiative to rework the project by myself, and incorporate more advanced analysis using my current skill set.

The analysis will include:
Data Cleaning/EDA/Text Analysis/SuperHost Analysis/Price Trend Analysis and Prediction/...To be continued.
